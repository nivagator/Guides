## SSLLabs.com A+ Grade changes

As of January 31st, 2020, [ssllabs.com has depricated tls v1.1 and 1.2](https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2018/11/19/grade-change-for-tls-1-0-and-tls-1-1-protocols) and caps grades to B where they exists
Per linuxbabe comments:

- To disable TLSv1 and TLSv1.1, edit the Letâ€™s Encrypt SSL options configuration file.
  - `sudo vi /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf`
- Find the following line.
  - `ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;`
- Remove the phased-out TLS version. Replace with this text
  - `ssl_protocols TLSv1.2`
- Save and close the file and test nginx configuration
  - `sudo nginx -t`
- Then restart Nginx.
  - `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
