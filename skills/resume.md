## Experience

The team also functions as a de facto in house consulting firm, offering analysis-based process improvement recommendations, key performance indicators and organizational support.

#### Reporting, Analytics and Automation
- Led project to enhance automated system designed to analyze the entire default loan portfolio and detect potential borrower harm based on over 800 individual business rules. The solution reduced process execution time by 70%.

#### Commitment to Customer Through Strategic Perspective
- Partnership with business going well beyond just reporting. Consulted the business regarding operations processes, operational performance metrics, technology solutions, project management and staffing capacity models.
- Specifically, took on the functional role as business liaison during the rollout of third-party audit application.
